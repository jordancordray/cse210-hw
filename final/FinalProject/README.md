# CSE210 Open ended project: Inventory app

The menu allows the user to choose between 4 options: 1. Display the current inventory, 2. Order products to add to the inventory, 3. Count the inventory on hand, 4. Simulate customer orders which subtract from the inventory.

The order in which the program should be used in is typically Order inventory, Simulate orders, Count inventory then display inventory.
